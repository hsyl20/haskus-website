#### 2016-11 -- MIDI event filter

One of our clients needed to filter MIDI events sent by a musical instrument
into appropriate MIDI events to control an arranger. We solved this by
interconnecting an Arduino that we programmed to perform exactly the required
task for a very cheap material cost (~50â‚¬).
