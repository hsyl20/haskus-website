| |system_icon|       | We are currently writing a book about using              |
|                     | `haskus-system </system>`_ to write your own environment on top    |
|                     | of the Linux kernel.                                     |
|                     |                                                          |
|                     | The book isn't fully completed yet. Please consider      |
|                     | `subscribing </subscribe>`_ to support its completion and the           |
|                     | development of Haskus system.                            |
