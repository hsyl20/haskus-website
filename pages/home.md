Haskus is a software development company. This is what we have been working on:

![Haskus system](/images/system_small.png)
[Haskus system](/system) is a new framework that we are developing to perform system programming with only Haskell and the Linux kernel (the framework was previously called ViperVM).

* [GHC development](/ghc): we participate in the development of the main Haskell compiler (GHC)

* [Arduino development](/arduino):

   <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.allons.mobi">allons.mobi</a>: a
   website designed for mobile phones to easily find places and attend events of
   interest (concerts, open stages, pubs, etc.).</li>
   -->

* [dynamic-linker-template](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/dynamic-linker-template): Haskell library that uses Template Haskell to easily create a dynamic library loading interface from a record (using field names for library symbols)
