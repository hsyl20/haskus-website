Helping us
==========

We write free open-source software, but we still need to earn some money to
live. To help us, you can:

Give a monthly tip
------------------

You can give us a small amount of money every month via Tipeee_. By doing this
you ensure that our developments can continue independantly. You can stop
tipping us whenever you want too.

Even a small contribution would be appreciated!

Pay for developments
--------------------

If you have specific development needs, don't hesitate to `contact us`_!
